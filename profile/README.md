# About This GitHub Organization

This organization is for the **DMIT-2008** course in the Digital Media and IT (*DMIT*) program at NAIT. To access the members-only resources, you need to be logged into GitHub.

## New Students

At the start of the term, your instructor will guide you in creating a free GitHub account if you do not already have one. Your labs and assignments for this course are centralized in this organization, so you will benefit by bookmarking this site in your browser.

Becoming a member of this organization is as simple as accepting any of the GitHub Classroom Assignments provided by your instructor. See the [Brightspace instance](https://lms.nait.ca/d2l/home) associated with this course for links to assignments.
