## New Students

At the start of the term, your instructor will guide you in creating a free GitHub account if you do not already have one. Your labs and assignments for this course are centralized in this organization, so you will benefit by bookmarking this site in your browser.

Becoming a member of this organization is as simple as accepting any of the GitHub Classroom Assignments provided by your instructor. See the [Brightspace instance](https://lms.nait.ca/d2l/home) associated with this course for links to assignments.

### GitHub Classroom Assignments

All coding assignments/labs are delivered via *GitHub Classroom Assignments*. Look in your class' [Brightspace instance](https://lms.nait.ca/d2l/home) for the invitation links for the individual assignments.

Classroom assignments may receive updates from your instructors. Information on finding and applying these updates can be found on the [**Lab Updates**](https://dgilleland.github.io/CPSC-1520/about/lab-updates/) page.

### Tools and Resources

The primary tool for this course will be [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com). In addition, there are some Command-Line tools that you will be using; check out this [*System Setup*](https://dgilleland.github.io/CPSC-1520/tutorials/0010/) guide on installing these tools. If you are new to CLIs (*Command Line Interface*), consider reading ["What is a CLI?"](https://github.com/resources/articles/software-development/what-is-a-cli)
